# Mantis Solana Engineer Coding Challenge

## Task

Write a Rust program (by program I don't mean "Program", you can writte this inside a SmartContract or just "external" solana interaction) to AddLiquidity() and RemoveLiquidity() on Raydium. You don't need to implement fancy logic, as long as those 2 functions work is totally ok.

Bonus points: do it on the same tx
